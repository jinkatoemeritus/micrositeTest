        <h1>Why Advanced Business Analytics?</h1>
        <p>Technological innovation has created a surplus of data availability. Terms like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data are becoming the norm in corporate decision making. As data keeps increasing, it also creates an asset from which you can extract crucial information. The question is no longer “do we need analytics?” Instead, the focus is on harnessing tools and capabilities to derive applicable insights.</p>

        <h1>Why Wharton Executive Education’s Advanced Business Analytics Program?</h1>
        <p>The Advanced Business Analytics Program (ABAP) is designed for executives who want to gain fluency in AI and analytics and how they shape decision outcomes — which includes both opportunities as well as challenges.</p>
        <p>The core modules are designed to ensure you get adequate grounding in the nuances of business analytics before you head into in-depth electives. It tackles two important aspects of business analytics. The first part is descriptive analytics where you dig into the data to find its quality, relevance, and importance — this is where you get your hands dirty with data. Once that is established, you move on to the next aspect of prescriptive analytics, which is the art and science of making decisions from observational data — the fun part.</p>
